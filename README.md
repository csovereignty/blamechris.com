A profile/resume website project built using Node.js and Express to help me get familiar with both. Using a pretty solid template from w3schools for the CSS, will need to update with custom CSS at some point in the future!

Planning to add functionality to the site to host some of my personal projects, will be slow going as currently in classes!
